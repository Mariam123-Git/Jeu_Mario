# Mario Game in Java üéÆ

## Description üìù

This project is a **Mario-inspired platformer game** created using **Java**. It was developed as part of my personal learning journey to strengthen my programming skills and to better understand the principles of **game development**.

The game mimics the iconic Mario gameplay, where the player controls a character (similar to Mario) to navigate through different levels filled with platforms, enemies, and collectibles. The game uses **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and handles interactions like jumping, running, and avoiding obstacles through key event listeners.

This project allowed me to explore key concepts such as:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementing classes, objects, and inheritance.
- **Game Logic**: Handling user input, collision detection, and level design.
- **Event Handling**: Managing key events (e.g., jump, move) through the keyboard.
- **2D Graphics and Animation**: Using Java's built-in tools to create and animate characters and environments.
